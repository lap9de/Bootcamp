# Title: Introduction to R and data manipulation
# Description: This session will be an introduction to the RStudio environment, basic scripting, and data manipulation using modern, user-friendly packages such as tidyr, dplyr, and stringr. Participants will engage in active learning with instructor-led tutorials for the morning and then the afternoon will involve participants tackling real-world data cleaning exercises.
